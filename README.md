I needed easy to use yet somewhat powerfull task manager. This is nowhere near what I would consider finished product, but at current stage, it is usable.

<h2>What I want to achieve?</h2>
- [x] Create task objects and store them in easy to managable format
- [ ] Implements synchronization between diferent directories
- [ ] Create better UI using one of TUI packages
- [ ] Package the app
