# daily-driver
I needed easy to use yet somewhat powerfull task manager. This is nowhere near what I would consider finished product, but at current stage, it is usable.

# What I want to achieve?
[x] Create task objects and store them in easy to managable format
[] Implements synchronization between diferent directories
[] Create better UI using one of TUI packages
[] Package the app
